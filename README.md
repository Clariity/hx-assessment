# hx Frontend Tech Assessment

This project is intended for use as part of Frontend Tech Assessment at hx. At it's core, this is a basic [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which shows off a Virtualizer component, allowing for live changes to its parameters.

The task is to review and and understand what the code is intending to do, and crucially what it is doing wrong/imperfectly. In this review you only need to concern yourself with the code in `src/component-library/Virtualizer.tsx`, if you like you may also examine how it is called within `src/App.tsx`, however this is not required.

There are no wholly correct solutions we are looking for, rather we are keen to see your thought processes and engineering approach, you may rewrite/comment/critique/take notes in whatever way you find easiest that we can refer to in a group discussion after the fact.

Good luck!
